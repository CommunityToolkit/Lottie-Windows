# Lottie Viewer
The Lottie Viewer project generates a simple Store app that renders and displays Lottie .json files. The tool is intended to help designers validate the appearance of Lottie compositions rendered using Lottie-Windows.

## Usage
Drag a Lottie file onto the Lottie Viewer window to see it rendered. If the orange warning icon lights up, click on it to see any issues that Lottie-Windows encountered.

### Generating code with Lottie Viewer
Lottie Viewer allows a Lottie file to be saved as generated code. The code generation uses some safe defaults. For maximum control and many extra features for generating code use the `LottieGen` command line tool.
