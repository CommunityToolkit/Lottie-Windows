# Lottie Viewer
The Lottie Viewer project generates a [Store application](https://aka.ms/lottieviewer) for previewing Lottie / Bodymovin JSON files. The tool is intended to help developers and designers validate the visual correctness of their Lottie animations rendered using Lottie-Windows.

## Usage
Drag a Lottie file onto the Lottie Viewer window to see it rendered, or use the "Pick a Lottie file" icon in the top left to open local files or URIs.
If the orange warning icon lights up, click on it to see any issues that Lottie-Windows encountered.

### Generating code with Lottie Viewer
Lottie Viewer allows a Lottie file to be saved as generated code. For maximum control and many extra features for generating code use the [LottieGen](../LottieGen) command line tool.
