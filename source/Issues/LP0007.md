# Lottie-Windows Warning LP0007

An Adobe Illustrator layer was included in the Lottie file. The layer may not be correctly rendered.

## Remarks
This is usually the result of some part of the animation being authored in
Adobe Illustrator. This adds extra data into the Lottie file that Lottie-Windows
currently does not understand. You can use After Effects to convert the Illustrator
layers to After Effects layers.
