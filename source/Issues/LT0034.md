# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0034

The specified UAP version is missing some functionality required by the Lottie animation.
The animation will still play, but may look incorrect.

## Remarks
Lottie-Windows generates code to run on the Universal App Platform. Some earlier versions of
this platform lack support for some Lottie features. You may be able to work around the
lack of support by modifying the After Effects project to remove the use of the unsupported
feature.

You can specify the minimum UAP version required when generating code with LottieGen.
