# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0035

Theme properties are an extension to Lottie that enable property values such as colors
to be updated at runtime. At runtime every element in a Lottie file that is bound to a
particular theme property name will get the same value, even if the values in the Lottie
file are different from each other. This may produce unexpected results.

To prevent this issue and ensure that the rendered Lottie file looks as expected, set
the values for each theme property name consistently.

## Remarks
The default value chosen for a theme property is the value that is set in the Lottie file.
If there are multiple values set for the same theme property name, the translator will
choose one of those values as the default.
