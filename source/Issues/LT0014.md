# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0014

The Lottie file contains a shape with multiple trim paths that cannot be combined by Lottie-Windows.

## Remarks
After Effects allows arbitrary numbers of trim paths to be applied to a shape. The trim paths are
meant to be combined in some way. Lottie-Windows currently has only limited support for 
combining trim paths.

In most cases the After Effects project can be modified to use single trim paths.

If support for more trim path combining is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
