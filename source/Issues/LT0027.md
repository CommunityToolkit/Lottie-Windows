# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0027

A Lottie file contains a shape layer or group that contains shapes that cannot be
merged by Lottie-Windows.

## Remarks
Currently Lottie-Windows is only able to combine multiple shapes if they are all paths.

If support for this feature is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
