# Lottie-Windows Warning LP0015

The Lottie file contains expressions, which Lottie-Windows does not currently support.

## Remarks
Lottie files may contain JavaScript expressions. Lottie-Windows does not currently support expressions because it renders animations using a declarative rendering system which disallows the imperative modifications allowed by JavaScript.

In many cases the same animation can be achieved without expressions. This will require the designer to adjust their After Effects project to use only key frame animations.
