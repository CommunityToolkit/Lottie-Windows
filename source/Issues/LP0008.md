# Lottie-Windows Warning LP0008

The Lottie file contains Layer Effects. Layer Effects are currently not supported
by Lottie-Windows.

## Remarks
Lottie does not support Layer Effects on most platforms. It may be possible to
work around this by modifying your After Effects project to avoid the use of Layer Effects.
