# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0010

The Lottie file contains a merge of too many shapes.

## Remarks
Lottie-Windows places a limit on the number of shapes that can be merged in a single MergePath.
It is not expected that any reasonable Lottie file will exceed this limit.

If support for a higher limit is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
