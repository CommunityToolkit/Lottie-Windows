# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0022

A layer in the Lottie file uses time stretching. Time stretching is not currently supported by Lottie-Windows.

## Remarks
Time stretching allows a layer to be played at a different speed from the overall composition. In most cases the same effect can be achieved by modifying the After Effects file without using time stretching.

If support for time stretching is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
