# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0037

A Lottie file contains a rectangle that has rounded corners via a corner radius, and also has round corners applied to it.

## Remarks
Currently Lottie-Windows ignores the round corners applied to a rectangle that ever has a non-0 corner radius.

If support for this feature is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
