# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0036

A Lottie file contains a shape layer or group that contains multiple paths with animations.

## Remarks
Currently Lottie-Windows is only able to combine multiple paths if they are all non-animated.

If support for this feature is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
