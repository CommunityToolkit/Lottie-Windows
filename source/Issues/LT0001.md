# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0001

A rectangle shape cannot be rendered if it has a trim path and its size is animated.

## Remarks
The combination of an animated size with certain types of trim path is not yet supported 
by Lottie-Windows. You may be able to work around it by adjusting your After Effects 
file, for example, consider converting the rectangle to a path instead.

If support for this feature is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
