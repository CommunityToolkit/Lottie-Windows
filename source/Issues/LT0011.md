# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0011

The Lottie file contains a shape with multiple rounded corner properties, and at least
one of them is animated.

## Remarks
After Effects allows arbitrary numbers of rounded corners to be applied to a shape. Currently
Lottie-Windows will ignore animations on a rounded corner if there are other rounded corners
applied to the shape.

In most cases the After Effects project can be modified to use a single animated rounded
corner in order to avoid this issue.

If support for this feature is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
