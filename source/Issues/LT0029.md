[comment]: # (name:InvalidAssetReferenceFromLayer)
[comment]: # (text:{layerType} referenced asset {assetRefId} of type {assetType} which is invalid. Expected an asset of type {expectedAssetType}.)

# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0029

An asset being referenced does not exist in the asset list. This indicates a malformed Lottie file.

## Remarks
Each type of layer can only reference certain types of assets. For example, a precomp layer can reference other layers but cannot reference an image asset, or an image layer can only reference image assets.

Lottie files contain a list of assets that can be referenced by other places in the Lottie file. An
asset that is referenced by a Lottie file must be of the correct type for the layer that is referencing it.
