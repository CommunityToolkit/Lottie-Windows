# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0030

The Lottie file contains a reference to an image file at the given file path. Currently
LottieViewer only supports images that are embedded in the Lottie file. 
Animations generated by LottieGen support linked image files, you just need to put the 
image to the `/Assets/LottieLinkedBitmap/{linked_image_path}` in your project.

## Remarks
Lottie files that reference images in other files are not currently supported by LottieViewer.

If support for image files is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
