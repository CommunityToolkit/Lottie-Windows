# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0030

The Lottie file contains a reference to an image file at the given file path. Currently
Lottie-Windows only supports images that are embedded in the Lottie file.

## Remarks
Lottie files that reference images in other files are not currently supported by Lottie-Windows.

If support for image files is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
