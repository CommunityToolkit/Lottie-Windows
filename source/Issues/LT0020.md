# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0020

The Lottie file indicates that it contains 3D content. Lottie-Windows does not support 3D content.

## Remarks
3D content in Lottie files is rare (as Lottie is primarily a 2D animated vector description). If the file is marked as having 3D content Lottie-Windows will output this warning, however it's possible that the file is simply incorrectly marked and the output will appear as expected.

Lottie files that contain 3D content will not render correctly with Lottie-Windows.
