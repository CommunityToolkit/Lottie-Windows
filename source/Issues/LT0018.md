# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0018

The Lottie file contains a repeater with a configuration that is not supported by Lottie-Windows.

## Remarks
Lottie-Windows has limited support for repeaters. Consider creating multiple copies of
layer contents in After Effects instead of using repeaters.

If more complete support for repeaters is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
