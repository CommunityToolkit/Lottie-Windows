# Lottie-Windows Warning LT0016

The Lottie file specifies round corners on a path. This is not fully supported by Lottie-Windows. 
It works correctly if the radius and shape path are not animated. If both radius and shape path 
are animated, the round corner modifier will not be applied at all, otherwise if only one of them 
is animated Lottie-Windows will try to generate an animation but it is not guaranteed to look exactly 
the same as in After Effects.

## Remarks
If support for this feature is important for your scenario please provide feedback
by raising it as an issue [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows/issues).
