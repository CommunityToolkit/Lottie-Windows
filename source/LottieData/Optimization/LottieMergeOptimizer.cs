            // 4. Decrease minimalScore in outer loop

            // So we are trying to merge pairs of layers with the higher score first, while trying to merge pairs that are nerby
            // because if we merge two layers that are far away then we can't insert any other layer between them (for merging).
            // Example: we have three layers [0; 10] [30; 40] [70; 80]

            // because they intersect.
