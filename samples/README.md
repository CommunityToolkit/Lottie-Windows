# Lottie Samples
The Lottie Samples project generates a [Store application](https://aka.ms/lottiesamples) that walks through the following basic scenarios to help users get started with Lottie-Windows:

* Getting started with json
* Getting started with codegen
* Configuring animation playback
* Displaying individual frames
* Interactive segments on a timeline
* The asynchronous Play method
* Handling failure and down-level
* Dynamically modifying animations

These samples explain concepts covered in the [Lottie-Windows Tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/animations/lottie#tutorials).
