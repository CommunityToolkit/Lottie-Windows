# Lottie Samples
The Lottie Samples project generates a simple C# UWP Store app that walks through basic scenarios to help users get started with Lottie-Windows. These samples cover the following topics:

* Getting started with json
* Getting started with codegen
* Configuring animation playback
* Displaying individual frames
* Interactive segments on a timeline
* The asynchronous Play method
* Handling failure and down-level
* Dynamically modifying animations

These samples elucidate concepts covered in the Lottie-Windows How-To documentation.
